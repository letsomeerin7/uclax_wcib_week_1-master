    <h3>Hi friends, I'm Erin. A new podcaster on a journey of self-discovery. Time to <span>Let Some Erin!</span></h3>
    <p>
      I'm brand new to the world of coding and plan on using my knew knowledge to build a website for my soon-to-be podcast, Let Some Erin. I'm working on a Macbook Pro.

      So far, this has been a bit of a challenging experience, but I'm hoping that a steep learning curve early on will mean it levels out and gets a little easier later? Is that a thing? I'm going to pretend like it is. First, I had trouble installing grunt and then determining if it actually was installed or not... Same thing with git. But then I did a little digging on their sites and tried the suggested commands and found they were indeed installed. Then, I had no remote setup with git and couldn't execute fetch and pull, but was eventually able to figure out how to fix it with a little googling. Of course I found the answer in the discussion board after I was done. The discussion board WAS helpful though when I was having some password problems with Terminal and Dreamhost. Reset and resolved. And then my Terminal just doesn't seem to want to respond to a bunch of commands, particularly ones starting with $. Mine seems to prefer % and I don't know if that's directly translatable or not. But we're getting there! This all might be totally out of my wheelhouse, but that doesn't mean it'll stay there. Si se puede!
